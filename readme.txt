Very simple plugin, though it will save blog editors one step rather than bumping
heads over publishing pending posts.

This plugin adds a new column to the post listing admin interface, showing which posts
have writers actively editing posts. Hover over the "Yes" under the 'Busy?' column
and you can see the name of the person editing the post.

== Installation ==

Activate in plugins admin screen. No options available. As of Wordpress 2.7, the
'Busy?' column can be hidden using the 'Screen' tab for the edit posts screen in
the admin interface.
